Production server = `https://ratesrebates.services.govt.nz`

## Installation ##

### To set up a development environment ###

This is an app built using [Json API suite](https://jsonapi-suite.github.io/jsonapi_suite/concepts)

1. make your own fork, and clone
  `git clone [repo]`

1. `cd pancake-backend`

1. Set up environment variables
  `cp env-example .env`

You will need ruby, the bundler gem to install dependencies. We recommend managing your ruby with a tool like rbenv or rvm

Install the dependencies

```
bundle install
yarn install
```

You will need a database. Any database supported by ruby
on rails / jsonapi suite should work, but we only support
Postgresql. Configure your database url in your `.env`, then:

```
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
```

To run the server:

```
bundle exec rails s
```

Seed the database and create a user:

```
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

This will pop up an invitation email for`juanvandenanker@gmail.com` in
your browser. If the server is running you will be able to click the
link to accept the invitation and set your password.

### To run the tests ###

```
bundle exec rspec
```

Test coverage report is at `coverage/index.html`
